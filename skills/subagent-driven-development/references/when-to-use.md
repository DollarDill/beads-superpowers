# When to Use

Read this when you are deciding between this skill, executing-plans, and brainstorming first.

```dot
digraph when_to_use {
    "Have implementation plan?" [shape=diamond];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" [shape=diamond];
    "Partner chose inline, or no subagent tool?" [shape=diamond];
    "subagent-driven-development" [shape=box];
    "executing-plans" [shape=box];
    "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [shape=box];

    "Have implementation plan?" -> "Tasks mostly independent?" [label="yes"];
    "Have implementation plan?" -> "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [label="no"];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" -> "Partner chose inline, or no subagent tool?" [label="yes"];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" -> "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [label="no - tightly coupled"];
    "Partner chose inline, or no subagent tool?" -> "executing-plans" [label="yes"];
    "Partner chose inline, or no subagent tool?" -> "subagent-driven-development" [label="no"];
}
```

**vs. Executing Plans (inline):**
- Fresh subagent per task (no context pollution) instead of one context doing every task
- Review after each task (spec compliance + code quality) instead of only at the end
- Costs a fresh context per task and per review; inline costs one context plus one final reviewer
- Both run in this session, share the same plan workspace under `.internal/sdd/`, use beads as the ledger, and never pause between tasks
